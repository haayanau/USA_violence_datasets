# Violence datasets for the United States


This project makes available two violence datasets built with daily event data sourced from [Project GDELT Events Database](http://data.gdeltproject.org/events/index.html) and GIS data sourced from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

The GDELT event data was collected by a series of algorithms with day-level granularity. Please see the table below for algorithm version details.

| algorithm version | start date| end date| news article source URLs| geocoordinates|
| --- | --- |--- | ---| ---|
| v1 | January 1, 1979 | December 31, 2005| No | Yes
| v2 | January 1, 2006 | March 31, 2013| No | Yes
| v3 | April 1, 2013 | March 1, 2024| Yes | Yes

The OpenStreetMap GIS data was collected using [Nominatim API](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/) and includes full geometry with all points, lines and polygons.
